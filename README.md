# Technical Services Workshop Setup Tools
This project aims to provide workshop facilitators with tools for setting up environments for workshop participants. TS-Workshop is designed for workshops with many participants so the workload can be distributed among several organizations.
In addition, projects used for workshops can easily be adjusted by the facilitator. Flows and detailed instructions for the workshop can be found [here](https://whitesource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TES/pages/2500984892/Customer+Workshops).

# Workshop environments
The current workshop setup includes 3 GitHub, SCA, and SAST organizations.
- Workshops typically include GitHub and SCA organizations, while SAST organizations are optional depending on workshop requirements ([SAST focused workshops](#sast-focused-workshops)).
- Additional organizations can be added on demand ([Extending workshop setup](#extending-workshop-setup)).

| GitHub.com organization  | SCA organization | SAST organization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [mendts-workshop](https://github.com/mendts-workshop) | MendTS-Workshop (https://saas.mend.io) | MendTS-Workshop (https://sast.mend.io/sast) |
| [mendts-workshop1](https://github.com/mendts-workshop1) | MendTS-Workshop1 (https://saas.mend.io) | MendTS-Workshop1 (https://sast.mend.io/sast) |
| [mendts-workshop2](https://github.com/mendts-workshop2) | MendTS-Workshop2 (https://saas.mend.io) | MendTS-Workshop2 (https://sast.mend.io/sast) |






# Appendix
### SAST focused workshops
The SAST scripts are disabled by default and should be uncommented to set up SAST organizations for workshop participants.
- GitHub actions - Uncomment Workshop-setup-sast/ Workshop-cleanup-sast steps.
- Local execution â€“ Uncomment SAST scripts
### Extending workshop setup
The following parameters will need to be updated to include the new organizations for extended [Workshop environments](#workshop-environments):
- GitHub parameters (GitHub scripts): Add link
  - GH_ORGS
- SCA parameters (SCA scripts): Add link
  - WS_APIKEYS
  - WS_USERKEYS
- SAST parameters (SAST scripts): Add link
  - SAST_API_TOKENS
### Modifying workshop content
- **Adding new projects for the workshop** - Add a new branch to this repo with the desired content (e.g., the easybuggy branch includes the [easybuggy](https://github.com/k-tamura/easybuggy) application).
- **Updating existing projects** - Navigate to the corresponding branch and update the application content accordingly.
